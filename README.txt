This project is a charicature of the WebForms applications I have worked on since the first beta of the .NET framework.
I use it as a starting point from my presentations on refactoring to Model View Presenter Passive View.

Branches:
master - This is the starting point. The code is untested and relatively untestable.
codecamp - This is the presentation I gave on Sept 10, 2011 at the Utah Code Camp.
